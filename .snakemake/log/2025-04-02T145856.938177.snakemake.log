MissingOutputException in rule download_database in file /home/wille182/git/ezmap/ezmap/snakefile.smk, line 93:
Job 1  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
databases/16S_bac.zip
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
